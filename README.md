# Ready to Play? ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ®

ðŸŽµ This is a personal project where I'm making a special and stylish music player where you can relax or have fun... Or both.

## Importance? ðŸ¤”

Listening to music has always been an important part of all of us, when we want to relax, when we need to study or even when we are playing videogames. But what happens when we are somewhere waiting and we can't just stay in there doing nothing?

Usually people just take their phones and play a videogame while listening music. What if?... What if there was an app where you can "play" a videogame and "play" your music at once?

## Open Source ðŸ’»

Big companies have control about what is allowed and what isn't, but we as community can make our own rules, that's why all the code is allowed to be used or edited by anyone.

## Future Features

In base of the use of this player, there's a list of features to be added:

 - Users allowed to upload their own songs
 - Wave mode
 - Minigames to play while listening music
 - Multilingual
